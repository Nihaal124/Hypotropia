        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> Hypotropia is a form of vertical strabismus where one eye deviates downwards in comparison to the other eye.</p>

        <h1>Symptoms</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <br>
        <p>Symptoms of hypotropia can range from cosmetic to visual perceptual. A cosmetic symptom of hypotropia is one eye appearing to drift or stay in a downward gaze position. This can happen to either the right or the left eye. In the visual perceptual space of symptoms, the patient can experience double vision stemming from the misalignment between the two eyes. The double vision often appears as two images "stacked" on top of each other, although it may also appear as two images stacked but one may appear slightly askew to the other due to the vertical deviation along with a horizontal deviation.

        <h1>Causes</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Hypertropia happens when the eye muscles are imbalanced and don't work together. The most common cause is weakness (called palsy) in the nerves in the brain that control eye movement.
...
Other common causes in adults include:
•	Stroke.
•	Thyroid disease.
•	Eye injury.
•	Neurological disorders.

        <p>Set Up:
            <br>
            <br>
1.Make a loop at the end of both of the white string.
            <br>
            <br>
2.Affix one end of the string to a doorknob.
            <br>
            <br>
3.Position the far bead near the end of the string closer to the doorknob. This is the far fixation bead.
            <br>
            <br>
4.Place the middle fixation bead about 2 ft -5 ft from you.
            <br>
            <br>
5.Place the near fixation bead about 6 inches from your nose.
             <br>
            <br>
6.Stand directly in front of the doorknob facing it. Put the loop around your index finger and hold the white string under your nose like a mustache,Hold the cord up to the bridge of your nose so that the cord is stretched tight between your nose and the doorknob.</p>
